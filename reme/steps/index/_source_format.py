"""Shared helpers: render retrieved chunks and assemble search-step answers.

Raw session transcripts (``*.jsonl`` under the dialog dir) store one serialized
``Msg`` per line. :func:`render_chunk_body` turns those back into a readable
dialog; all other chunks keep their raw ``text``. Used by
``search``/``vector_search``/``bm25_search`` so every step renders session hits
identically.

:func:`format_chunks_answer` assembles a full answer string from a list of
chunks, with optional per-chunk score formatting and link expansion. Raw
session chunks from the same file whose line ranges overlap, contain one
another, or are adjacent are merged into their union before rendering (see
:func:`_merge_session_chunk_intervals`) so a passage is never shown twice.
:data:`ALL_RETURNED_MESSAGE` is the English notice shown when tool_context dedup
removes every previously-returned result. :data:`NO_RESULTS_MESSAGE` is the
English notice shown when the search returned no results at all.
